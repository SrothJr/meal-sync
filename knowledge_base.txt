## 1. General Questions

**Q: What is Meal Sync?**

A: Meal Sync is an online platform that connects people looking for regular, home-cooked meals with talented home-based cooks in their neighborhood. Subscribers can sign up for weekly or monthly meal plans, and chefs can run their own small business from home.

**Q: How does it work?**

A: It's simple! Subscribers browse menus from chefs in their area, pick a weekly or monthly plan, and select the meals they want. After payment, the chef prepares the meals on the scheduled days, and a delivery person brings them to your door.

**Q: Which areas do you operate in?**

A: Meal Sync is a hyperlocal platform currently operating exclusively within Dhaka. When you sign up, you specify your area to see chefs and menus available near you.

**Q: Is this a food delivery app for single orders?**

A: No, Meal Sync is a subscription-based service. We focus on providing regular meal plans (weekly or monthly) to make your life easier, rather than one-off orders.

**Q: How do I create a menu?**

**Q: How do I manage new subscription requests?**

A: When a new client subscribes to your menu, it will appear in your "Chef Subscriptions" page with a "Pending" status. You have the option to review and either "Approve" or "Reject" the request.

**Q: What do I do after I cook a meal?**
