### MVC Architecture

This project follows the **MVC** architecture. The codebase is divided into 3 distinguished  sections called **Model** , **View** and **Controller**. The Model handles the creation of Database objects, it uses MongoDB (Atlas) as its core. For this project (as of now),  we are using the online free tier version of MongoDB. For the View part, We are using the **React** framework for `Javascript`. Which enables us to dynamically inject `html` to our pages with added functionality. For the styling, we are using *Tailwindcss* to style the pages within the same `html` code. The Controller handles all the backend logic and programming, creating, injecting and fetching data from Database and serving it to our frontend application built with `reactjs`. 

### MERN Tech-Stack

The `MERN` Tech-Stack is widely used for creating modern web applications. This is designed for **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** which allows the browser to render the UI by executing the `Javascript` code. This way, the browser does not need to request a whole new page from the server, with React handling  the routing on client side, it can fetch necessary data from the API and dynamically update the parts of the page that have changed. As part of the modern web development paradigm, the `MERN` stack embraces **Single-Page Application (SPA)**. 

#### Why MERN for this project?

- Full-Stack JavaScript Experience
- Non-Blocking Backedn with High Performance
- Flexible Data Storage with MongoDB
- Interactive UI with React
